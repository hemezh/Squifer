<strong>Aim:<u>Our basic belief is that “if we share  our resources  and make it freely available to all other fellow beings world will be a better place.”</u></strong><br><br>
 <strong>Main Problem:</strong><br>Hunger for Knowledge.At some time we need some book very badly but the main problem is to where to find.Sometimes we need it only for some topic and for that we donot need to buy it.We are also in lazy era so if there is something online from where we can read it will help us save some calories<br><br>
 <strong>Our Solution</strong><br>
 We decided to make a website where everyone can pool in their resources by sharing the ebooks they have.Anyone can visit the site look for book and can read it.
